# Weather-app-using-python
This code defines a function get_weather() that takes a city name as input and returns the current weather information for that city. The code uses the requests library to make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and json library to parse the JSON data in the API response.

To use this code, you need to sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace the API_KEY value with your own key. Then, you can test the function by calling get_weather() with a city name.
